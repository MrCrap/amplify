# amplify
Build AMP Pages quickly. Minify/compress files. AMP validation from the command line. [Learn more about AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/learn/overview/).

I created Amplify to help me build AMP pages. I was tired of writting CSS in the `<head>` and wanted an easy way to validate the page.

## Getting Started

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nickFalcone/amplify.git
$ cd amplify
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

## What amplify does
amplify simplifies the process of building AMP pages in four steps:

1. Converts scss => css => minified css => piped into the ```<style amp-custom>``` [tag as required by AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/design/responsive/style_pages)
2. Minifies html and includes required amp boilerplate/tags
3. Compresses images
4. Validates AMP using [gulp-amphtml-validator](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/fundamentals/validate#npm-packages-for-ci)

## Project Process/Structure
* HTML files from src/components are minified and piped to Public 
* images from src/img are compressed and piped to Public/img
* src/style/style.scss is converted to src/style/style.css, minified, and injected into public/index.html
*Do not edit style.css - this file is generated by Gulp*
```
amplify
└───public
    └───img
    └───index.html
    └───data
        | data.json
└───src
    └───components
        | index.html
    └───img
    └───style
        | style.scss
        | style.css
    └───data
        | data.json
└──node_modules
| gulpfile.js
| package.json
| README.md
| .gitignore
```

## Tasks
* ```$ gulp``` The default build process.  Deletes the Public directory and then recreates it with the current build.  This ensures that Public doesn't contain leftover files that were not generated by the current build.
* ```$ gulp amphtml:validate``` Runs AMP validation test for each HTML file in Public.
* ```$ gulp clean``` Deletes the Public directory.

## Versioning
amplify follows [SemVer](http://semver.org/)

**1.0.0** - create initial gulpfile.js.  update README.
**1.1.0** - add examples of fetching data and manipulating state.
